# Indeed-scraping-and-EDA:

### Motivation of this project :
Alike every data scientist aspirant I also have curiosity about job market trends, skills demand, and employer preferences, which can help me to improve my career prospects and decision making. To investigate those questions I started these project. 

### This project aims to scrape and analyze data science job postings from Indeed.com, a popular job search platform. The main objectives are:

- To collect relevant information about data science jobs, such as title, company, location, salary, description, skills, etc.
- To perform exploratory data analysis on the scraped data, such as finding the most common skills, the correlation between variables, etc.
- To visualize and communicate the findings using charts, graphs, tables, etc.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- BeautifulSoup 4
- Requests
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required packages using pip:

### The project consists of two main parts:
- ***SCRAPING:*** The scraping part uses Python libraries such as **requests**,**BeautifulSoup**, and **pandas** to extract and store the data from Indeed.com. 
- ***ANALYSIS:*** The analysis part uses Python libraries such as **numpy**, **scipy**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**,**NLTK**, and **wordcloud** to manipulate and visualize the data.

#### The project is organized as follows:

- README.md: This file contains the overview and instructions for the project.
