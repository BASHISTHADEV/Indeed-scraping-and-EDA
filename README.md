# Indeed-scraping-and-EDA
### Motivation of this project :
Alike every data scientist aspirant I also have curiosity about job market,roles and reposibilities of data scientist. To investigate those questions I started these project.
### Why Indeed ? :
Indeed is a US-based job search engine which has now expanded to over 60 countries around the world. The first thing that strikes you as soon as you log on to this job portal is the clean and minimalistic interface. Unlike there job sites which are crammed with words and images, Indeed looks easily accessible and organized especially for a new job seeker. You could almost say that it is the Google of job search portals.
    Biggest doesnâ€™t always mean best, but I chose Indeed as the best overall job website due to its size, number of industries and lifestyles catered to, and its unmatched update frequency. 
### Technical Aspect :
This project is divided into two part:
1) Scraping data s using **Beautiful Soup**,**Python Requests**  from Indeed 
2) Cleaning the data using **NLTK**, **WORD CLOUD** and Visualization it using **MATPLOTLIB**, **PLOTLY**.
